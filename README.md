These directories contain compile script (for different HPCs) for Elmer/Ice and
some important dependencies. It also contains simple pieces of code that I wrote
or amended and were used in simulations or might be used in some future
simulations. There are also some more complicated bash submission scripts and
sif inputfiles for simulations that will be of use in the future for reference.
